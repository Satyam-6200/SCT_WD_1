## ✨ Key Features Explained

### Fixed Navigation
The navigation menu uses `position: fixed` to remain visible at the top of the viewport while scrolling.

### Scroll Detection
JavaScript monitors scroll events and toggles a `scrolled` class when the user scrolls past 50 pixels, triggering style changes.

### Hover Effects
CSS transitions and pseudo-elements create smooth color changes and animated underlines on menu item hover.

### Mobile Menu
A hamburger icon toggles the mobile navigation menu, which slides in from the right on smaller screens.
